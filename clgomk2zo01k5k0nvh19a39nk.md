### What is a computer virus?

A computer virus is a type of **malicious software designed to replicate itself and spread from one computer to another.** It can damage or corrupt files and programs on the infected computer and even spread to other devices connected to the network. Viruses can be spread through email attachments, downloads, or infected websites.

### What are the types of computer viruses?

Several types of computer viruses can infect a computer system. Here are some of the most common types:

1. **File Infector Viruses**
    
2. **Boot Sector Viruses**
    
3. **Macro Viruses**
    
4. **Polymorphic Viruses**
    
5. **Worms**
    
6. **Trojan Horses**
    
7. **Ransomware**
    

### File Infector Viruses:

File infector viruses are a type of computer virus that **infects executable files on a computer system, such as .exe or .com files**. Once a file is infected, the virus can spread to other files on the system, making it difficult to detect and remove. When an infected file is executed, the virus code is activated and can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as deleting files, stealing data, or spreading to other computers on the network. File infector viruses are typically spread through email attachments, downloads, or infected websites.

To protect against file infector viruses, it is important to have antivirus software installed on your computer and keep it up to date. Additionally, be cautious when opening emails or downloading files from unknown sources and avoid clicking on suspicious links.

### Boot Sector Viruses:

Boot sector viruses are a type of computer virus that **infects the boot sector of a computer's hard drive or a floppy disk**. The boot sector is part of the disk that contains the code necessary to start up the operating system. Once infected, the virus can spread to other disks and computers that the infected disk is connected to. When a computer is infected with a boot sector virus, it may fail to boot or experience other issues. The virus can also overwrite or corrupt files on the infected computer, causing data loss or other problems.

Boot sector viruses are typically spread through infected disks or USB drives. To protect against boot sector viruses, it is important to avoid using unknown or unverified disks or USB drives and to scan any external media with antivirus software before using it on your computer.

### Macro Viruses:

Macro viruses are a type of computer virus that **infects files created with certain programs that contain macros, such as Microsoft Office documents** (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint). Macros are small programs that can be embedded in these files to automate tasks or add functionality.

When a file containing a macro virus is opened, the virus can execute and perform a variety of malicious actions, such as deleting files, stealing data, or spreading to other files on the system. Macro viruses can be spread through email attachments or infected files downloaded from the internet.

To protect against macro viruses, it is important to have antivirus software installed on your computer and keep it up to date. Additionally, you can disable macros in your Microsoft Office settings or enable macro security features to restrict their use. It is also recommended to avoid opening attachments or downloading files from unknown or unverified sources.

### Polymorphic Viruses:

Polymorphic viruses are a type of computer virus **that can change their code or signature to avoid detection by antivirus software.** Each time a polymorphic virus replicates, it modifies its code or uses encryption to create a new, unique signature. This makes it difficult for antivirus software to detect and remove the virus.

Polymorphic viruses can infect various types of files, including executable files, documents, and media files. They are often spread through email attachments, infected downloads, or infected websites.

To protect against polymorphic viruses, it is important to have updated antivirus software installed on your computer. Additionally, you can use email filters to block suspicious attachments or links and avoid downloading files or software from unverified sources. It is also important to regularly update your operating system and software to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited by viruses.

### Worms:

Worms are a type of self-replicating malware **that spread over a network, often exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems to infect other computers.** Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach themselves to a host file or program to spread.

Worms can spread rapidly and can cause significant damage to computer systems, including stealing data, deleting files, and creating backdoors for hackers to gain access to the infected computer.

Worms can be spread through email attachments, infected downloads, or vulnerable network services. To protect against worms, it is important to keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches and to use a firewall to block unauthorized network access. Additionally, you can use antivirus software and email filters to help detect and block worms. It is also important to be cautious when opening emails or downloading files from unknown or unverified sources.

### Trojan Horses (Most Common):

Trojan horses, or simply "Trojans," are a type of malware t**hat disguises itself as legitimate software to trick users into downloading and executing it.** Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not self-replicate, but they can open backdoors to allow hackers to gain unauthorized access to the infected computer.

Trojans can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive data, downloading and installing additional malware, or hijacking the victim's computer to participate in a botnet. They can be spread through email attachments, infected downloads, or infected websites.

To protect against Trojan horses, it is important to be cautious when downloading software or files from unverified sources. Additionally, you can use antivirus software and email filters to help detect and block Trojans. It is also recommended to keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches and to use a firewall to block unauthorized network access.

### Ransomware (Most Common):

Ransomware is a type of malware that **encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.** Ransomware can be spread through email attachments, infected downloads, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems.

Once a computer is infected with ransomware, the victim's files are encrypted, making them inaccessible. The ransomware then displays a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. In some cases, the ransomware may threaten to publish the victim's data or delete it permanently if the ransom is not paid.

To protect against ransomware, it is important to regularly back up your files to an external device or cloud storage and to keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches. Additionally, you can use antivirus software and email filters to help detect and block ransomware. It is also important to be cautious when opening emails or downloading files from unknown or unverified sources, and to avoid clicking on suspicious links.

> Important Fact:
> 
> **WannaCry is a type of ransomware that caused a global outbreak in May 2017.** WannaCry encrypted files on infected computers and demanded payment in Bitcoin in exchange for the decryption key.
> 
> It caused widespread damage to computer systems worldwide, including in hospitals, banks, and government agencies.

### How to stay safe from Viruses/Malware:

1. **Use antivirus software:** Install reputable antivirus software on your computer and keep it updated to protect against malware.
    
2. **Keep your software up to date:** Install updates and security patches for your operating system and software as soon as they become available.
