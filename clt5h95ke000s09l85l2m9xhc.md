### What does self-hosting actually mean?

Self-hosting refers to ***the practice of hosting and managing your own online services or applications on your personal server or hardware***, rather than relying on external or third-party providers. When you self-host, you have greater control over the software, data, and privacy of your digital activities.

This means you can set up and maintain your own email, website, or other online tools, reducing dependence on external companies. Self-hosting allows individuals and organizations to have more autonomy and ownership over their online presence.

### Why do people self-host media/applications?

People choose to self-host media or applications for various reasons, often centered around ***control, customization, and privacy***. By self-hosting, individuals and organizations can have greater control over their digital content and services.

They can tailor the setup according to their ***specific needs, modifying features and configurations to suit their preferences***. Additionally, self-hosting allows for increased privacy, as users retain ownership and management of their data, reducing reliance on external platforms that may collect or monetize personal information.

Furthermore, self-hosting can be a cost-effective solution for those who prefer to invest in their own infrastructure rather than subscribing to external services. While it requires technical knowledge and effort, self-hosting empowers users to shape their online experiences according to their preferences and values.

### What do I (P R Harshith) self-host currently?

Sometimes i'll self-host using ***a paid VPS from Hostinger*** or running it locally on my Ubuntu 23.04 machine. Currently, I'm learning to use ***Docker*** for these tasks. I mainly use these setups to host ***Jellyfin (for media), Navidrome (music server), FileBrowser (file management), Remote Access VPN, Immich, and a Minecraft server***. They help me stream media, manage music, organize files, securely access my network, and run a Minecraft gaming server when needed.

I personally manage my entire music library, consisting of ***over 1000+ EDM songs***, through self-hosting. All the tracks are in ***CD-Quality FLAC(Free Lossless Audio Codec), ranging from 16/44 to 24/44 bits***. My decision to move away from *\[MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE\]* was driven by its subpar audio quality, restrictions on downloads, and the annoyance of frequent ads and mainly the question "*what if they go out of business and stop working!?* ".

Instead, I opted for a paid app called "[**Symfonium**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.symfonik.music.player&pcampaignid=web_share)," available on the Play Store for around â‚¹240 at the time of writing this. My music is stored on Google Drive, and the app seamlessly facilitates listening to and downloading my high-quality tracks.

[**Symfonium**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.symfonik.music.player&pcampaignid=web_share) offers additional features like song caching and smart playlists, meeting my music needs perfectly. Although the transition from *\[MUSIC STREAMING SERVICE\]* in November 2023 involved a challenging learning curve in configuring and securing my self-hosting setup to prevent exposure to internet threats, the effort has been worthwhile. I've enjoyed the freedom and control that comes with self-hosting my music.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, self-hosting provides individuals with the power to take control of their digital experiences. By managing their own servers or utilizing ***Virtual Private Servers (VPS)***, users can independently host various services and applications according to their preferences.

This approach offers ***customization, privacy, and freedom from dependency on external platforms***. While self-hosting requires some technical know-how, the benefits include the ability to curate personal solutions, such as ***media servers, file management tools, and even gaming servers***.

It empowers users to dictate the terms of their online presence, ensuring a tailored and secure environment for their digital activities. However, it's crucial to approach self-hosting with ***a commitment to learning and maintaining security measures*** to safeguard against potential risks. Overall, self-hosting stands as a rewarding option for those seeking autonomy and control in the digital realm.
